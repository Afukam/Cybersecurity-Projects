Phishing is not fishing, but if you’re wondering what that means, it’s a form of social engineering in which an attacker sends a phony message in an effort to deceive a target into giving the attacker access to sensitive information or to installing malicious software, like ransomware, on the victim’s infrastructure.

You might have received emails telling you that you won money, got a significant discount, or even saw a bank statement.

A phishing mail sample(full mail)

It may be simple to identify such a letter, text, or phone call, but there are ways to avoid falling victim.

But you must first understand something in order to be able to recognize it.

### Types Of Phishing

*   Spear Phishing:

“Spear phishing” is a sort of phishing effort that targets a specific individual or group and frequently includes material that the target is known to be interested in, such as current events or financial papers.

*   Whaling:

Whaling is a highly focused phishing assault that masquerades as a legitimate email and targets top executives. Whaling is a type of technologically enabled social engineering fraud in which victims are encouraged to perform a secondary action, such as initiating a wire transfer of money.

*   Vishing:

The deceptive activity of making phone calls or leaving voice recordings claiming to be from trustworthy organizations in order to get people to divulge personal information such as bank account numbers and credit card numbers

*   Email Phishing:

Arguably the most widely known form of phishing, this attack is an attempt to steal sensitive information via an email that appears to be from a legitimate organization. It is not a targeted attack and can be conducted en masse.

*Fun facts:*

*Did you know that Project Aurora (the Google hack of 2009) occurred via an employee clicking a phishing email?*

*Did you also know that according to Verizon’s 2021 DBIR, around* ***25%*** *of all data breaches involve phishing, and 85% of data breaches involve a human element?*

### Common ways to spot a phishing

*   The message is sent from a public email domain. No legitimate organization will send emails from an address that ends ‘@gmail.com’.
*   The domain name is misspelled.
*   The email is poorly written.
*   It includes suspicious attachments or links.
*   The message creates a sense of urgency.

*But these are just a few*

But there's a catch to these, as AI may help, so you may want to rethink and learn new ways. What do I mean?

A tweet that made me try this

While there are many advantages of AI in our workplace — for example, sending emails is simpler, and even articles and ideas are easier to generate — it still looks like a dream come true, doesn’t it?

That may suggest that in order to recognize phishing, we will need to acquire new techniques as threat actors become more sophisticated.

I spoke with my AI acquaintance briefly in order to demonstrate this.

You can tell that threat actors may have even gotten masterclasses on how to compose believable click baits to send to unsuspecting victims.

*But there's no need to panic; there are still other ways you can identify phishing.*

*   Check the sender.
*   Check the receiver.
*   Zero-trust: Be as skeptical as you need to be before you click any link, even those from families or friends as they may also be victims.
*   Your bank and social media platforms wouldn’t tell you to tell them your pins or login.
*   Before hitting that discount link, verify with the site to see If they are truly running a discount.

#### What can I do, if I have clicked on a link that I am unsure about

*   Well before filling in your details, go to the original site to verify
*   Play spot the difference( check with the original site and notice the differences with the one you want to use)

While AI is very very lovely, we constantly have to remind ourselves just as with every technology, we need to learn, unlearn and relearn so that we don't become outdated ourselves.
