I’m not sure when it started or even where to begin my story, but first, happy new year... I know it’s been ages since I wrote here, and that’s because I just didn’t know where to start. To be honest, I still don’t know how to begin.

Whilst it may not be so surprising, I’ve always been a high achiever. When you grow up with the quote ‘Die once, live forever', you tend to forget that you are also human, and you don’t necessarily need to ‘die’ because you could just take a break and you’d still be able to ‘live forever’.

Sometime last year, I was working on some projects, juggling a job, reading for school, trying to get into school, college applications, visa applications, and the overall anxiety that each process brings, while dedicating 2 hours every day to my cybersecurity journey. Initially, it would seem like I had it figured out and was doing it right, but that was until I got burned out.

BURNOUTS

We’ve all seen articles and videos and even gotten advice that tells us just to do the work, but what happens when you keep on showing up to the point where you ignore your body’s plea for help? Initially, I thought that my burnout could be fixed with some motivation, or maybe a day off or YouTube; however, I realized that I needed to take a break.

I wasn’t sure why, but I did feel guilty a lot (any tips for learning how to take breaks would be appreciated, btw), but I just dealt with it and came to the realization that breaks weren’t self-destructive. So take that break. Now that I’m back from my break, I feel better.

I look forward to doing more of this

Your favorite cybersecurity buddy.
