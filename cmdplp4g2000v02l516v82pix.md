I just want to say a big thank you to everyone who has been reading and 1earning from my articles, if you haven't checked my last article, feel free to check it out at https://link.medium.com/V3i7nWoIzyb, let's get into it shall we?

> Clickbait:   
> (on the internet) content whose main purpose is to attract attention and encourage visitors to click on a link to a particular web page.  
> "These recent reports of the show’s imminent demise are hyperbolic clickbait"- Google.

Recently, I’ve been job hunting which has led me to search and apply for a lot of jobs - if you’re in the job market at this time, I wish you luck and godspeed - anyways on the 21st of March, it seemed like the universe aligned in my favor and my days of job hunting was finally over, plus it happened to be a remote job, a dream comes true right?

So I did what I always do when I receive a link.

Hmm, it was a link that had never been flagged malicious before, however, I still had my uncertainties as I did not remember applying to any freelance job, for that specific purpose. But then it’s job hunt season so anything may be possible right???

#### But what does the body of the mail say?

Remember the tips I gave on how to spot phishing?

*   Grammatical error
*   Tone of urgency
*   Suspicious link etc

Although the link was not suspicious there seemed to be a tone of urgency. So I decided to read the mail further, and I found this.

At first glance you may not notice it, but look closely at the salutation, and yes these 2 messages were gotten from the same mail.

So I decided to do my due diligence and check out what the link was about — you already know where thus the story is going right — yes it was not a legitimate freelance deal.

#### LINKS AND ME

Just because a link is not malicious does not mean that it is not clickbait, some links may have never been flagged as malicious, but it doesn’t mean that they are safe, a cybercriminal can still intercept your data. Don’t forget to always do your due diligence.

Have fun and stay safe while you’re online.
