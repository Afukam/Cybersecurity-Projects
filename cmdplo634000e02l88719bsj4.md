You remember how growing up, it was such a bada\*\* stuff to connect to wifi, or even to get into your neighbor’s, church or even eateries and how when you’re successful you cheer and share the password with others… To be honest, I don’t blame you, I mean especially when they had names like this

With their passwords along the line of password, or 123456789 or something so lame. Or maybe you’re still doing it, I mean to be honest those were pretty fun and dumb times.

However what you may not know is that you’re putting your device and your personal information at some risk. Some public WiFi are highly vulnerable thus making all devices connected to them put at risk.

Imagine a senerio where you’re quite far from a church, however you when you check available networks you still see the church’s wifi name, and so without much thought to it you connect to the wifi–in your defense they were still using password as their password– and so you get down to your business of the day ; responding to sensitive emails, doing some bank transactions, logging into twitter to argue what West African Country makes the best jollof rice, and some other sensitive transactions. In other words you’ve connected to the evil twin

Or even a senerio where you connected to the correct wifi but it has been comprised and there’s Malware in the air– this was a cheeky adaptation from that song Lovers in the air– without knowing put a whole lot of stuff at risk.

Here are some measures to take when stealing your neighbour’s wifi… I mean using a public wifi.

#### Step 1 :

You’d want to make sure you have the correct wifi connected, the average wifi has a distance of 150 feet or over 45 meters for a 2.4Ghz frequency, I get it, it’s kind of unrealistic to start counting how many feet apart you are from your free wifi source, so think of it this way, if the area of the free wifi is down your street, count 2 houses away and if you still receive a signal with the same name, it probably isn’t the wifi you are sure about so don’t connect to it.

#### Step 2:

Make sure you use a VPN. VPN’s encrypt your data, putting you at less risk.

#### Step 3:

Install an anti-malware and anti-virus software. The thing is you’d want to be sure that you’re not having any of those bad boys come into your system, so this would help a lot.

#### Step 4:

Turn off the auto correct and auto download options. For obvious reasons.

#### Step 5:

Do not access sensitive information while using the wifi.

#### Step 6:

Resist the urge to click on any pop up that appear on your device.

Have fun using that wifi and donf forget to stay cyber safe.
