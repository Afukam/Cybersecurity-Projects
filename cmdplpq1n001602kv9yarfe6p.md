You may have heard how fast and ever-changing the technology world is. Now, I'm not even talking about engineering (though it still falls under "tech"); I'm talking about the part of tech that people think of, like front-end developers, back-end developers, AI, UI/UX, full-stack developers, and so on; yes, because the list is so long.

Now, before I start this story, I'd like to inform you that at the time I was writing this, I had never put my hands behind the wheel to drive, so by "drive," I'm talking about finding a place that you feel you’d spend part of your life doing.

Anyway, we may proceed. I'm one of those "over-Sabi" (if you see this and you don't know what that means, it means those people that do too much) people, so getting into tech wasn’t in any way what I had considered at all, but here we are.

So I met this person one day, and that opened my eyes to the possibility of me being a badass programmer. I won’t tell the story because it’s pretty long, but then I decided to take a chance on it (some days I wonder what was going through my head when I chose to). This is where my reckless driving skills come in, so I decided to start with the same old HTML and CSS, which, to be honest, I'm not sure if every "technical" person needs to know, but what can I say? Me sef Mumu, we start by imitating what others do. I carried my head to the point where I didn't know, then someone said, "No, Python is for bad biches." Then I left JS hanging to go for Python; however, while downloading resources for my JS, I also downloaded resources for Java, and then in my mind, shebi, they both have Java in front of them; maybe they are the same thing.

If you think that was bad, let's not even go to all the "free stuff" I hoarded, because looking back at those things I signed up for, I'm not even sure why I did it; I guess because I heard free and free is good or something, but hopefully by the end of this decade, I’ll be done with them (I didn’t make a promise right there in case this pops up sometime in the future), and at some point, I realized that having a lot to do doesn't mean you're being productive; sometimes you may just be wearing yourself out (no wonder we sometimes learn less at schools).

Anyway, let me continue my story by moonlight, and so I decided to avoid registering for irrelevant free things, and if you ask me, that has been one of the best things that I have done because it has helped me figure out my career path.

How I figured out my path:

While it is so easy to get lost in driving in circles, perhaps I’d advise you to slow down and not be like me, as I wore myself out quickly, and you may want to ask yourself these questions, or do these first:

What drives me on this tech journey?

Am I a creator, a problem solver, an all-rounder, or a mixture of many other things this child didn’t list in this blog?

Do I see myself going into the non-coding side of tech, or am I one who may love coding or programming?

If I am not into coding, do I see myself writing, designing, or doing something like that?

If I am into coding, what is my niche?

What language does my niche require?

Remember:

Google is your friend

it's okay to take your time while learning, but it doesn't mean its not for you

You don't have to use every framework you see online; find what works best for you.

Don't register for every free or discounted thing that you will not need; it's okay to say no to free things.

don't feel pressure, you are doing so well already

It's never too early or late to learn, you just have to want to learn.

So where am I in tech?

I'm sure now that you have read this, you may be wondering where this blog ends or you may be saying how nice this is; hopefully, you say good things.

Well, I am on my cybersecurity learning journey, so in some blogs, I will be talking about cybersecurity, and in others, I'll just be very random. Either way, I am only human.

As we go on, we remember all the time we’ve spent together as our lives change from whatever we will still be, what and whoever we are…..

If you’ve hung in till this part, you're the real MVP, and hopefully, you’ve found my tips and story helpful to you.

till next time, i am Afukam…
