#### I simply want to express my sincere gratitude for all the encouragement I have received since I began writing. Now let’s get started, shall we?

Recently, I had a conversation with someone I’ll call Z. They complained about debit alerts despite the fact that they hadn’t placed any orders for purchases, but what particularly caught my attention was the fact that they hadn’t clicked on any suspicious links, responded to any suspicious calls, or even given anyone their card information, so I wondered what might have happened.

This was what was on my mind

So I questioned Z about their use of social media, including if they had many pen pals or if they worked as a part-time influencer.

However, there was no firm response—just the typical "Yes, I have various social media accounts, but what are they for?"

We all contribute to the vast amount of data that exists in our quick-paced technological world, whether it be by posting random events about ourselves, responding to questions, or even writing this article. But what do we actually tell people about ourselves?

Now, this isn’t referring to in person or at events, but rather to what data we publish online.  
Yes, there is no denying that social media has its benefits. After all, we receive a ton of information, opportunities, and even life-changing experiences thanks to it, including the ability to connect with loved ones who live far away, meet new people, form lasting relationships, share memes, watch videos, listen to the news, and a long list of other things.

While some researchers are still trying to understand the psychology behind how easy it is to share a lot about ourselves, what does that data mean to cybercriminals?

I was able to learn about Z’s complete life from their date of birth—one of the most frequent things we post online—to their home address—please don’t do this—to their workplace—not a terrible idea—to their family and personal lives—just by clicking on their profiles.

While it is no doubt nice to have the whole social media personality status, what you put out there should also be taken into consideration.

Open Source Intelligence( OSINT):

> Open-source intelligence is the collection and analysis of data gathered from open sources to produce actionable intelligence.

The availability of our data makes it simpler to identify someone’s profile with a cursory internet search. I saw that Z had a lot of mother and kid advertising in her inbox, which was not surprising given that she was expecting, so this may be more targeted marketing.

This is the interesting part of the story….

Even though it appeared to be an outdated photo, I could make out the credit card information on one of her images, and it worked like a charm. Remember that I already knew her home address — I used reverse image lookup — and her postal code thanks to a Google search.

So she unknowingly gave away that information.

Now this is just one of the many instances or ways a single information can be someone’s next free paycheck.

#### But I don’t think I have such pictures?

Are you sure? I mean from your profile can I get a lot of information about you, to send you targeted phishing mails?

Open Source Intelligence is not a bad thing, as it helps create more data, make search easier and can even be used to stop crimes. However, the information we put out there should be put with caution.

Thank you for reading and if you have any questions or would like to chat, feel free,

Till next time, bye.
