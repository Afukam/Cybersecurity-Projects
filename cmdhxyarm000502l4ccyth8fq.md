If I were to build a security policy for my company, I would start with the email security policy. Emails can sometimes be a company’s most vulnerable entry, as seen in Project Aurora by Google, Ubiquiti Networks, Save the Children, the City of Saskatoon, and just to mention a few. Given my series on [`Malware Analysis`](https://afukamwrites.hashnode.dev/malware-101) and [Phishing](https://medium.com/@afukam/click-bait-6684bec3fa1), a common point of entry, was email, so I would go on that first, assuming I have 90 days to figure out a security policy.

My first cause of action would be to analyze our business model, communication channels, and risk factors; including our risk tolerance, risk acceptance level, while ensuring that this in no way becomes redundant or difficult for end users to navigate as sometimes, too much security especially when rolled out in such as short time can be too much for end users who may have already gotten used to the system, and the last thing any business wants is to be slower in functionality (another longer / more stakeholder friendly way of looking at the risks involved). Of course FURPS would be taken into account, as i am assuming that i am building a system from start and would have to meet with subject matter experts on my system analysis progress. Assuming I have 90 days to start building my security policies this would be my email security policy for my company.
